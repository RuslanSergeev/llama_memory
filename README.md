# LLama memory

This project unleashes the pover of GPT chatbots on your own knowledge bases.
It allows you to:
- Chat with your particular documents
- Chat with your entire knowledge base
- Chat with your systems tools, such as python or bash
- Perform sequence of requests and analyses to finish your jobs.

# Examples

1. [GPT agent showcase](https://gist.github.com/RuslanSergeev/ba902eab988173b0b21cc1befc47afb6) - The system executes complex unprogrammed tasks.
The system analyzes users request, writes a programm, launches the interpreter and shows the result.
This appeared before there was such a pluggin in chat-GPT.
3. [GPT knowledge-base cli showcase](https://gist.github.com/RuslanSergeev/8e5d84bac8c4a4932322829fcfee8f0e) - shows the agent accessing a knowledge base, containing my duties description.
